    "Congratulations! We have reached the end of this exercise. To recap, the tutorial introduces the basic components that make up LangChain. We have experimented `schema`, `models` and `prompts`, and studies how to make sure of `indexes`, `chains` and `memory` to build functioning products that solve context issues with LLMs and extend their capabilities. Finally, we arrived at `agents` where we explored semi-automated workloads and I hope that inspires you to build!\n",
