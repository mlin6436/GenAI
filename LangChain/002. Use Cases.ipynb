    "\n",
    "Langchain summarization is one of the most common usage of LangChain and LLMs. It can summarize any amount of text or documentations, including the ones that exceeds the token limit (currently set at `4096 tokens` for `gpt-35-turbo`), which roughly equates to `3000 words`. \n",
    "\n",
    "The technique used is similar to the concept of `sliding window`, which a fixed size window, usually under the max context window limit, is used to chunk the the long document into smaller pieces, then summarize the content recursively to produce the final summary using mapreduce.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use it to summarize not only text, books, documents, audios, social media threads, and etc. Some use cases including: _articles_, _research pagers_, _legal and financial documents_, _transcripts_, _chat history_, _customer interactions_, _product reviews_, _podcasts_, _twitter threads_ and more."

The problem is solved by converting the context and your question into [embeddings](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings/what-are-embeddings), basically a list of vector value representaiton of information; then find out a few results that are closely related to your question before giving out a final answer. The process to do the comparison is via an algorithm called [cosine similarity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosine_similarity). If you are getting confused by the description, don't worry. The formular is as following: \n",
